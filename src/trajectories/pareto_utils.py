        The Pareto front is approximated as a polyline: the ordered sequence of
        ``pf_points`` defines consecutive line segments, and the distance returned
        is the minimum Euclidean distance from ``y`` to any of those segments.

        For each segment [A, B] the closest point on the segment to ``y`` is found
        via orthogonal projection:

            t = dot(y - A, B - A) / ||B - A||²

        ``t`` is clamped to [0, 1] so that the closest point is constrained to the
        segment rather than the infinite line through A and B. This ensures correct
        distances when ``y`` lies "outside" the extent of the front (i.e. beyond
        either endpoint).

        Args:
            pf_points: Pareto front points of shape ``(k, n)``, ordered along the
                front. Adjacent points define the segments of the polyline.
            y: Query point of shape ``(n,)`` whose distance to the front is sought.

        Returns:
            Scalar tensor containing the minimum distance from ``y`` to the front.
